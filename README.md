There are some other works where simple algorithms are inferred via neural networks. For example, in [10], the operations of copying and sorting an array are performed with a fully differentiable network connected to an eternal memory via attention.

In another approach, [11] presents a sorting experiment for sets of numbers using a sequence to sequence model.
