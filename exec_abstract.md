## Relational reasoning in deep learning: a parallel between solving visual and programming tasks

### Abstract

### Ideas

- abstraction and reasoning in a minimalist setup, to model a measure for intelligence of AI systems
- answering questions based on scenes with objects
- solving a task by writing a program which maps input (initial state) to output (finish state) from dream coder
- exploiting relations between objects as prior knowledge
- integrating relational reasoning into deep learning models
- using deep learning to estimate the probability of a primitive existing inside a program from deep coder
- for general program synthesis, it is necessary that an AI can derive the relations between the objects it acts on (eg. object oriented programming)

### Datasets

1. ARC - input & output grids (1, 2)
2. Synthetic/collected datasets - programs, inputs & outputs, primitives, DSLs (6, 7)
3. CLEVR - images (4, 5)
4. Open Images (3)
